# VirtualSynth
The idea of this project is to use an arduino as a controller in an Samson Graphite 49 to transform it into a synthesizer instead of a midi controller. While it's hard to create a digital synthesizer the first objective has been formed into: use an arduino as the MIDI controller in the Samson graphite 49 MIDI controller.

In the folder VirtSynth firmwareX.X you will find the code to use your arduino as a MIDI controller. When the code is complete to control a Samson graphite 49 MIDI controller. The code will be made more dynamic and builtin in a GUI in which you can assemble a MIDI controller. This program will also substitutes the programs needed on your PC to transform Arduino serial messages into MIDI messages and to simulate virtual midi ports.

TODO:
  MIDIFControllerFirmware
    -Analog controls (sliders, mod- and pitchwheel) support.
    -Button interaction
  GUI
    -Still needs to be created
